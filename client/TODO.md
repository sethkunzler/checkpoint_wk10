TODO:
✅❌🟨
10 Requirements (
 students must complete at least 3 to receive turn around time.
 students may miss up to 2 and still be passing.
)

❌From the main page users can login/logout and manage their profile
  -- must be able to edit account profile in some way
❌From the main page users can change the displayed recipes between all, favorites and the users recipes

❌Recipe cards show title, subtitle, category and image

❌Clicking on a recipe opens the recipe modal
❌The Recipe modal shows all the recipe details, including the ingredients and steps for that recipe
❌The owner of a recipe can delete a recipe, make sure this removes all favorites tied to it
❌The owner of the recipe can add, edit and delete ingredients and steps to the recipe

❌🟨When creating recipes the title and subtitle validate string length while category is selectable from a dropdown

❌Logged in users can mark recipes as 'favorites'

❌Users can search recipes by category


8 Stretch Goals:

❌Search includes title, subtitle, and category

❌Users can comment on any recipe
❌Users can rate/score/like a recipe then sort and filter by that value

❌Utilize a route query, so when users share the link with friends it will open the applicable modal when navigated to

❌Users can share recipes to social media via a 'share' button

❌Users can create 'tags' instead of just category, establishing a many to many relationships, try to make this robust where tags of 'entree', 'Entree' and 'ENTREE' could not be duplicated. Also consider from a UI standpoint how users could see existing tags before just creating a new one.

❌Instead of just favorites consider something like 'collections', allowing users to create lists of recipes they could group together to see all their 'vegetarian' or 'gluten-free' favorites

❌Create a button that will allow you to 'print' a recipe, the printed version should be a cleaner more printer friendly layout. There are a lot of ways to do this, try to avoid bringing in new libraries
